# Auth0-CTF-2021-Writeup
Writeups for my solutions to the Auth0 CTF in 2021

The CTF went on for a week from Oct 18 - Oct 25, 2021. We ended up in 60th/ 631 teams by solving 13 questions, of which I solved 10. Overall it was really fun and I learned
a lot about mistakes made in software development that lead to insecure software. Nothing matches the learning experience of getting your hands dirty and playing around with
the theory in practice.

9 of the problems I solved were web exploitation problems. I also solved 1 cryptography problem. Hopefully these writeups are useful to someone, I know I had a great time
figuring them out.

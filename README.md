# Auth0-CTF-2021-Writeup
Writeups for my solutions to the Auth0 CTF in 2021

The CTF went on for a week from Oct 18 - Oct 25, 2021. We ended up in 60th/ 631 teams by solving 13 questions, of which I solved 10. 
Overall it was really fun and I learned a lot about mistakes made in software development that lead to an insecure product. 
Nothing matches the learning experience of getting your hands dirty and playing around with the theory in practice.

I've done my best to make the writeups coherent and consistent with the experience of solving them, but all of these were
written after the CTF ended. Some of the screenshots used were taken during the CTF but much of them were taken after on local docker containers so the flags may often be the fake test flag they gave on the local code.

9 of the problems I solved were web exploitation problems. I also solved 1 cryptography problem. Hopefully these writeups are useful to someone, I know I had a great time figuring them out.

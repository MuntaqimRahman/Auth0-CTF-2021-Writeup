## Investigation

We didn't get any code files for this problem. They only gave us a website with this landing page.

I've done one CTF before (picoCTF2018) and I learned there that SQL injection is a pretty common exploit. It's generally one of
the first things I try before I've formally started looking for exploits. On a whim I tried the first line
in the Wikipedia article for SQL injection.

## Solution

That Wikipedia line being:

```
' OR '1'='1
```

Putting that into both the Username and Password fields let you login and get the flag.
